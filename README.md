# Coffee Sales Data Analysis & Prediction Project

## ☕ Project Overview
Coffee sales data provides valuable insights into customer preferences, seasonal demand, and revenue patterns.  
This project analyzes **coffee sales transactions** and applies **predictive techniques** to estimate future sales performance.

The goal is to convert raw sales records into meaningful insights that can support **inventory planning, pricing strategy, and demand forecasting**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
This project was designed to:

- Analyze historical coffee sales trends
- Identify top-selling products and categories
- Understand customer purchase behavior
- Study seasonal and time-based sales patterns
- Build a predictive model to estimate future sales

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
- Data Type: Coffee sales transaction data
- Format: CSV
- Granularity: Order-level / Daily sales data
- Key Columns:
  - Order Date
  - Product Name / Category
  - Quantity Sold
  - Sales Amount
  - Store / Location (if available)

Data preprocessing was required to address missing values and inconsistencies.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
To ensure reliable analysis, the following steps were performed:

- Converted date columns into datetime format
- Handled missing and null values
- Removed duplicate transactions
- Standardized product and category names
- Aggregated sales at daily and monthly levels
- Created time-based features for trend analysis

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helped uncover key business insights, including:

- Daily and monthly sales trends
- Product-wise and category-wise sales performance
- Seasonal sales patterns
- Revenue contribution by product type
- Identification of peak sales periods

Visualizations were used extensively to communicate findings clearly.

## 📈 Prediction & Modeling Approach
Predictive analysis was performed to estimate future coffee sales:

- Trend and seasonality analysis
- Moving averages and baseline forecasting
- Time-series or regression-based prediction methods
- Comparison of historical vs predicted sales patterns

The prediction results support better demand planning and decision-making.
